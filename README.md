# Labour-Economics--Gender-Gap-Cope-Zimmerman-law-and-women-managers
This project examines the effects of the 2011 Copé-Zimmermann law on women's access to and quality of managerial positions in the companies concerned.

Context : 
The 2011 Copé-Zimmermann law sets quotas for the composition of company boards for companies with more than 500 employees and annual earnings of more than €50 million. 

Research question : 
Beyond its impact on women's representation on boards, what are the effects of this law on women's access to managerial positions and their representation in terms of hierarchical position and pay relative to men within the companies affected?

Data: 
We use DADS administrative data on employees and companies, which we merge using the latter's unique SIREN. Our clean database provides average information on employees at the firm level (share of managers, share of part-time employees, etc.). In particular, we have information broken down by gender.

Empirical approach : 
Using a difference-in-differences specification between affected and unaffected firms over the pre- (2004-2009) and post-reform (2010-2015) periods, we examine the potential positive spillover effects of this law on women's access to and quality of managerial positions in these companies.

Results : 
In particular, we find no significant effect on women's access to managerial positions compared to men. However, we highlight a small positive effect on the hierarchical structure of women within these firms (among all female employees, women tend to access managerial positions more often than remaining lower in the hierarchy). These effects highlight the need to extend this law to managerial positions within firms.


Due to statistical confidentiality, we cannot provide the database used for the analysis. However, we do provide the construction and analysis codes used for this study. The files are ordered: to build the database you just have to run them in order.

This project thus includes several files:
- Data : includes the codes that we used to construct our clean dataset.
- Regression : includes the codes that we used for our regressions
- Other : some codes which we used to solve some minor problems, and which are normally not needed to re run the code.
